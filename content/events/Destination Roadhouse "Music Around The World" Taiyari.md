Ravi Albright is a professional tabla player and the Executive Director of Seattle Tabla Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization offering ongoing classes, workshops, and musical events throughout the year in Seattle, WA. Born in Seattle, Ravi has been a student of North Indian classical tabla drumming in both India and the U.S. since his youth. He is one of only a few ganda-banda (formally recognized) disciples of Pandit Anindo Chatterje of Kolkata, India. Abhishek Arora has grown up with a deep appreciation of Indian classical music since his childhood. He began his musical journey at a young age, learning harmonium and vocal music under the guidance of his mother. His exploration of Indian classical music expanded when he studied the sarod, a 23-string fretless instrument that produces smooth sliding notes (similar to a slide guitar) along with intricate percussive patterns. Abhishek studied the sarod under the mentorship of Brandon Machintosh, an internationally recognized performer and teacher based in Seattle. Over the past 10 years, he has also been studying the bansuri, the Indian bamboo flute, under the guidance of Shakthidhar Iyer, a world-renowned flautist based in India. For the past 16 years, Abhishek has been teaching meditation through music, conducting seminars and tours across the U.S. His performances guide listeners on a meditative journey of self-discovery, using this ancient music to connect with the inner self. When he's not playing music, he is excited to share the beauty of Indian classical music with us today through this performance.
